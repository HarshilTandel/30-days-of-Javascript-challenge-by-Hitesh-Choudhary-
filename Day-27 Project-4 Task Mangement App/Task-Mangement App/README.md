# To-Do App

## Description

This is a simple yet functional To-Do application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and manage their tasks through a clean and interactive interface. Completed tasks are listed separately from pending tasks, and users have the option to edit or delete tasks.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Mark tasks as completed, which then move to a separate "Completed Tasks" list.
- **Edit and Delete**: Edit or delete tasks from both the pending and completed lists.
- **Date and Time**: (Optional) Add timestamps for when tasks are added or completed.
