**📌 Task 2:** Write a program to print the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.

## 🎯 Activity 2: While Loop

**📌 Task 3:** Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.

**📌 Task 4:** Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.

## 🎯 Activity 3: Do...While Loop

**📌 Task 5:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do...while loop.

**📌 Task 6:** Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

## 🎯 Activity 4: Nested Loops

**📌 Task 7:** Write a program to print a pattern using nested for loops:

## 🎯 Activity 5: Loop Control Statements

**📌 Task 8:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but skip the number 5 using the continue statement.

**📌 Task 9:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop the loop when the number is 7 using the break statement.

## 🚀 Feature Request:

1. **🔢 Number Printing Script:** Write a script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop and a while loop.
2. **✖️ Multiplication Table Script:** Create a script that prints the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.
3. **⭐ Pattern Printing Script:** Write a script that prints a pattern of stars using nested loops.
4. **➕ Sum Calculation Script:** Write a script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
5. **🧮 Factorial Calculation Script:** Create a script that calculates the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

## 🏆 Achievement:

By the end of these activities, students will:
- ✅ Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
- ✅ Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.
- ✅ Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
- ✅ Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- ✅ Use loop control statements (break and continue) to control the flow of loops.
