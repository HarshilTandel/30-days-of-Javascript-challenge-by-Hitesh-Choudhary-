# 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge 🚀

### Day 1: Variables and Data Types 📊
- Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.

### Day 2: Operators ➕➖✖️➗
- Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
- Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
- Compare values using comparison operators.
- Combine conditions using logical operators.
- Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.

### Day 3: Control Structures 🔀
- Implement and understand basic if-else control flow.
- Use nested if-else statements to handle multiple conditions.
- Utilize switch cases for control flow based on specific values.
- Apply the ternary operator for concise condition checking.
- Combine multiple conditions to solve more complex problems.

### Day 4: Loops 🔄
- Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
- Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.
- Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Use loop control statements (`break` and `continue`) to control the flow of loops.

### Day 5: Functions 🔧
- Understand and define functions using function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
- Use function parameters and default values effectively.
- Create and utilize higher-order functions.
- Apply functions to solve common problems and perform calculations.
- Enhance code reusability and organization using functions.

### Day 6: Arrays 📚
- Learn to create and manipulate arrays.
- Use array methods such as `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`.
- Understand and apply higher-order array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- Iterate over arrays using `for` and `forEach` loops.
- Combine arrays and extract elements using spread syntax and destructuring.

### Day 7: Objects 🧩
- Understand the basics of creating and using objects in JavaScript.
- Learn to define object properties and methods.
- Access object properties using dot notation and bracket notation.
- Update and delete object properties.
- Understand the concept of nested objects.
- Use `this` keyword within methods to reference the object itself.
- Iterate over object properties using `for...in` loop.
- Use `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, and `Object.entries` to work with object properties and values.
- Understand object destructuring to extract properties.
- Create and manipulate arrays of objects.
- Use object methods to add functionality to objects.

### Day 8: ES6+ Features 🌟
- Understand and use template literals for string interpolation and multi-line strings.
- Apply destructuring to extract values from arrays and objects.
- Utilize spread and rest operators for array manipulation and function arguments.
- Define functions with default parameters.
- Create objects using enhanced object literals, including methods and computed property names.
